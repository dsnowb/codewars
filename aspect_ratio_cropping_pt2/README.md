# Codewars - Aspect Ratio Cropping, Part 2

## Problem
This kata is a continuation of Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 1 .

Comparing two different aspect ratios poses some subtleties â€“ when comparing two aspect ratios, one may compare images with equal height, equal width, equal diagonal, or equal area.

Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This time your function should accept a third input "constant," specifying the variable to remain constant in your conversion. The variable constant can have a value of either "height", "width", "diagonal", or "area". Round your answers up to the nearest integer.
