# Codewars - Circular Primes

## Problem
Based on Project Euler problem 35

A circular prime is a prime in which every circular permutation of that number is also prime. Circular permutations are created by rotating the digits of the number, for example: 197, 971, 719. One-digit primes are circular primes by definition.

You must write a program that dertermines if a number is a circular prime.
