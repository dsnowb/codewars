# Codewars - IP Validation

## Domain
Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format. IPs should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between 0..255 (included).
Input to the function is guaranteed to be a single string.
Note: leading zeros (e.g. 01.02.03.04) are considered not valid in this kata!
